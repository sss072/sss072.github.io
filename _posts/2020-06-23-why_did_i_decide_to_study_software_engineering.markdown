     When I was young all I cared about was having fun and doing things that I enjoyed/made me happy. This was my motto up until I was 18 years old. Growing up in a culture and ancestry where as a child you are given only a handful of options to go into as an adult (doctor, engineer, lawyer etc), one would be frowned upon if they were to chose an alternative to any of these options. If ever did an adult ask me about what career would I be interested in going into when I grow up, I would usually give a cliche answer like engineering for example even though I knew nothing about it and what one would do in it as a career description. I guess part of me just didn't want to grow up and kept putting things off. Despite the fact that both my parents were doctors, I knew for sure that I wouldn't go into was medicine and becoming a practitioner in it due to the length period required in education.
		 
		 Once my senior year was over and I had to decide on what classes to choose for my first semester in college, I was confronted with the dilemma of choosing my major and classes related to it. So i asked a dear friend of mine to point me in the right direction. He said that the best thing for me to do was to choose a career that is related to a subject that I am good at and enjoy. We both knew immediately that it was mathematics and logic. This might be a taboo topic to talk about here in Western Society as we are always told to pick something that we enjoy and not worry about how much it pays but being a realist I cared decently about the paygrade of the career that I wanted to go into. Another criteria that I was worried about was with all this Artificial Intelligence, Automation, and Technology in general progressing so fast was job security/job demand of the field that I would have gone into. Software engineering seemed to check all these boxes so I signed up for my first class in it which was "Intro to Python". I loved the creativity involved in it and the satisfaction one gets after finishing a problem that they have been stuck on. And yeah after that class, I have never looked back.
